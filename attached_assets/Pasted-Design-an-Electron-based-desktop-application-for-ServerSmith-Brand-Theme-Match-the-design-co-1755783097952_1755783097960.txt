Design an Electron-based desktop application for "ServerSmith".

Brand Theme:
- Match the design, color palette, and style of the ServerSmith logo.
- Maintain a clean, modern, professional look.
- Light Theme: based on the logo’s background/primary colors.
- Dark Theme: inverted version of the same palette (dark background, logo accent colors for highlights).
- Buttons, links, and section headers should use the logo’s accent colors for hover and active states.
- Subtle animations (hover glow, smooth transitions) that reflect the logo’s aesthetic.

Home Page (Dashboard):
- Display the ServerSmith logo at the top with tagline: "Build Your Own Minecraft Server with Ease".
- Grid of feature cards styled to match the logo theme:
  • Basic Server Setup (Singleplayer → Multiplayer)
  • Plugins & Mods (Spigot, Paper, Fabric, Forge)
  • Advanced Multi-Server Setup (BungeeCord, Velocity, Waterfall)
  • Troubleshooting & Optimization
- Each card should have matching icon style, hover color effects from the logo theme.

Guides Section:
- Written tutorials with step-by-step instructions and screenshots.
- Categories: Basics, Plugins, Mods, Advanced.
- Search bar styled with the logo’s accent color.

Video Guides Section:
- Dedicated page for advanced setups (proxy & multi-server configs).
- Embed YouTube or local video tutorials in a clean player.
- Video player controls should adopt the logo’s theme colors.

Navigation:
- Persistent left-hand sidebar navigation.
- Sections: Home, Guides, Video Guides, FAQ, Contact.
- Sidebar and icons must reflect the logo’s palette (accent highlights).
- Smooth expand/collapse animation.

FAQ Page:
- Accordion-style expandable Q&A.
- Styled with the same font/color style as the logo’s theme.
- Content focused only on server creation and setup.

Contact Page:
- Single contact option: serversmith@gmail.com
- No office address or phone number.
- Buttons and form fields styled with the logo’s accent.

Theme Switcher:
- Fixed button at the bottom-right corner.

- Button itself should use the logo’s accent colors.

Technical Notes:
- Smooth window resizing.
